This is my first ever project.
I used Excel to clean, filter and take out insights with the help of dashboard.
I worked with the Crime_dataset_2020-2024 from Kaggle which contain 40,161 rows and 23 colums , and  needed significant cleaning and organization.

 Here's how I transformed it:
- Applied Data Filtering and Sorting
- Used Find and Replace, Aggregate Functions, and Text/String Functions
- Utilized Date/Time Functions, Logical Functions, and Conditional Aggregation
- Employed Lookup Functions, Pivot Tables, and Charts
- Implemented Slicers for dynamic insights

I also inserted a panel in every sheet which joins different sheets in the workbook with each other. This panel help to navigate from one sheet to another as every 4 icons are attach with 4 sheets with the help of hyper link.

The result is a comprehensive and well-structured dataset ready for in-depth analysis. Excited to explore the trends and insights this data reveals!
